# 0. 주안점

논문의 요지 → 1) 어떤 새로운 기술을 도입해 2) 이만큼의 향상된 결과를 냈다

- 즉, 논문의 핵심은 → ‘향상된 결과’를 낼 수 있었던 원인이 ‘어떤 기술’ 인가
- 추가로, ‘이만큼 향상됐음’의 근거는 무엇인가

이번 논문 과제의 의도는 연구실이 기반하고 있는 연구 분야가 무엇인지 이해하는 것이라고 생각

따라서 ‘기술’에 주안점을 두고 논문 리딩 진행

**시행착오**

- Appendix가 기술set 설명과 매우 밀접해 보여, 원활한 이해를 위해 Approach Overview를 읽고 바로 Appendix를 읽었음.
    - 그러나 Appendix는 핵심 기술의 component 레벨 요소에 관한 세부 설명이었음
    - 즉 논문 본문을 다 읽고 Appendix를 읽는 것이 효율적이었음

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Abstract

![image.png](/assets/img/posts/2025-01-26-KARONTE/image.png){: width="100%" height="100%"}

- IoT devices - Software on these systems(Firmware)
    - Analysis challenged
        - Hardware-dependent
        - Not-standardized Environment → 1) unique & minimal 2) non-standard configurations
    - Analysis complicated
        - Multiple Binaries
            - Addressing the communication between executables is complicated
- KARONTE
    - Static
    - Modeling & Tracking **multi-binary interactions**
    - Starting from taint information → insecure interactions → vulnerability identification
    - Evaluation
        1. On Tracking&Constraining Multi-binary interactions abilities
        2. On Scaling ability about:
            1. firmwares with various size and complexity 

<br>

# 2. Background

### Emersion of IoT devices

- Vast amount of IoT devices introduced new-coined threats into cybersecurity landscape
- Techniques that are invented, especially in the perspective of unpacking binaries, were insufficient

<br>

### Constraint of traditional analysis techniques

- **Interconnected components**(functionality based on multiple programs execution)
    
    ↔ analysis without accounting for the **internal flow of data**
    
    → Ignore **meaningful constraints** arise from inter-binary communication
    
    → Inability to **differentiate sources of input**(attacker-controlled or non-attacker-controlled)
    
    → Limited search performance that leads to uncovering **only superficial bugs**
    

**Hence**,

- Consideration about **multiple binary execution** is necessary
- Analysis on the **data shared** among multiple binary is necessary

<br>

### KARONTE

- Static
- Track data flow
- Intuition:
    1. **IPC paradigm used in one firmware is likely to be finite**
    2. Derive commonalities in the paradigm set
    3. Use the commonalities to detect input locations & inter-component interactions
    4. Use the verified interactions to track inter-component data flow
    5. Perform cross-binary taint analysis
    6. Detect insecure uses(potential vulnerabilities)

<br>    

# 3. Approach Overview

여기 설명된 항목 정리하고 Appendix에 나온 거랑 매핑해서 정리하자

<br>

## 3.1. Firmware Pre-processing

- unpack firmware sample using ‘binwalk’

<br>

## 3.2. Border Binaries Discovery

- ‘Border Binary’: Binaries that export the device functionality to the outside world
    - Represents the point where accepts user requests & references user-controlled data

<br>

## 3.3. Binary Dependency Graph(BDG) Recovery

- ‘BDG’
    - Directed graph
    - Models communication among border binaries by leveraging **CPF(Communication Paradigm Finder) modules**

<br>

## 3.4. Multi-binary Data-flow Analysis

- By using ‘static taint engine’, the KARONTE:
    - Tracks data propagation
    - Collects data constraints
- Simulate data propagation applying features gathered
    - from the target binary b to other binaries that have inbound edges from b

<br>

## 3.5. Insecure Interactions Detection

- Identifying security issues

<br>

# 4. Border Binaries Discovery

<br>

# 5. Binary Dependency Graph(사실상 CPF가 핵심)

<br>

## 5.1. Purpose and Overview

- BDG: detects data dependencies & model data propagation (setter binary → getter binary)
- Challenges:
    - Inter-binary data propagation:
        - control flow information is useless because:
            - processes do NOT normally access other processes’ memory regions.
- Solution:
    1. Model IPC paradigms by using CPFes(Communication Paradigm Finders)
    2. Use modeled paradigms to build a graph == BDG(Binary Dependency Graph)

<br>

## 5.2. Communication Paradigm Finders

### Objective

- Detect & Describe specific IPC paradigm which binary uses to share data
- 1)  explore binary & program path → 2) Does the path contains the necessary code to share data through the communication paradigm? → 3) If so, conduct deeper analysis using techniques below → 4) create edges of BDG utilizing features distinguished
    1. Data Key Recovery
    2. Flow Direction Determination
    3. Binary Set Magnification

<br>

### Key Functionalities

1. **Data Key Recovery**
    1. referenced by the binary for IPCs
    2. fundamental & essential → THE MOST IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE
2. Flow Direction Determination(scope: one binary)
    1. Role of each program points: ‘Setter’ & ‘Getter’
    2. program points: access the data keys
3. Binary Set Magnification(scope: whole firmware)
    1. if any ‘binaries’ refer to the data keys → scheduled for further analysis

<br>

### Implementation

- ‘Semantic CPF’: OS-Independent
    - Intuition: ‘Data Keys’ *IPC must rely on them *Often hard-coded in binaries
- KARONTE uses:
    - Environment CPFes
    - File CPFes
    - Socket CPFes
    - Semantic CPFes

<br>

## 5.3. Building the BDG

(시간이 부족한 관계로 우선순위 하강)

<br>

# 6. Static Taint Analysis

The operation of the underlying taint engine

<br>

# **7. Multi-Binary Data-Flow Analysis**

How KARONTE combines the taint engine with the BDG to do detection

BDG

BFG

<br>

## 7.1. Key Insight & Concepts

- Paths with fewer constraints on user data dd are more likely to expose vulnerabilities.
- BFG: Extended version of the BDG in the direction of ‘least strict set of constraint applied to the data shared among multiple binaries’

<br>

### 7.2. BFG Building

1. Initialization
2. Constraint Propagation

<br>

# 8. Insecure Interations Detection

Detection Target:

1. Memory-Corruption bugs
2. DoS vulnerabilities

<br>

# 9. Discussion

<br>

# 10. Evaluation

<br>

# 12. Conclusion

+) Emphasizing the effectiveness of KARONTE

→ 어떻게 insecure interactions를 알아냈는지에 관해 설명할 수 있는 게 중요한 듯해, Evaluation 파트는 나중에 읽어보는 것으로 함

# Appendix

> Background를 읽으면서 이걸 같이 봐야 할 것 같음

<br>

### A. Functions Identification

3 types of functions is the goal of distinguishment

<br>

1. **memcmp-like functions**
    
    
    👥: sementically equvalent to memory comparisons
    {: .notice}
    
    1. **methodology**
        1. If the target function $f$ contains at least one loop, then:
            1. Scan the instructions in the body of the loop in the linear manner and list every program point $p$ which contains memory comparison instructions
            2. Compute a static backward slice $p$ → $f$’s entry point
            3. Inspect $f$’s args to clarify whether they could affect operands in $p$ and if so, then:
                1. $f$ becomes a candidate of memcmp-like functions
                2. Calculate the size of $f$(based on number of its basic blocks)
                3. Adopt `BootStomp`’s threshold to decrease the number of false positives
2. **strlen-like functions**
    
    
    👥: calculate the length of a buffer
    {: .notice}
    
    1. **methodology**
        1. **similar to memcmp-like function search** implementation + ‘the existence of **counter**, which increases as the number of loop iteration goes’
3. **memcpy-like functions**
    
    
    👥: copy the content of a memory location to another
    {: .notice}
    
    1. **methodology**
        1. same with the methodology of `Bootstomp`
4. **function body is not available**
    1. Heuristically match strings on the name of the function
    
    (opinion) It may become an armpit of this system
    
5. **Optimization strategy**
    1. Harness function generation: abstract the functions described above to minimize the resource of repeated execution
        
        → mitigate the ‘path explosion problem’
        
        → speed up, without losing precision.
        
<br>

### B. Border Binaries Discovery

**Connection mark → Flag**

**Network mark → Counter**

Calculation Hardness: Connection mark >>>>>>>> Network mark

1. Network mark calculation
    1. Retrieve all the **memory comparisons** within a binary == Assume these will **refer to hard-coded network related strings**
    2. The strings mostly referred within **the basic block(the call to the memory comparison, too)**
2. Connenction mark calculation
    1. Forward static taint analysis + Backward static taint analysis
    2. Limitation on the {Number of functions analyzed, Time of symbolic exploration}
    3. For the case of path(source-sink) exploration failed:
        1. any imprecision from a function $f$ analysis⇒ analysis for $f$ is incomplete
        2. over 50%(setted threshold) of experiments ends up in incomplete analysis, then:
            1. conservatively set the connection mark.
    4.  Regarding OS dependency: if the OS is unknown, then simply set the connection mark.
3. Utilize the feature ‘cmp’ when calculating Parsing Score.

### C. Communication Paradigm Finders

<mark> Purpose of CPF: When recovering BDG(Binary Dependency Graph), by leveraging CPF, it becomes able to map inter-binary data flow.</mark>

<br>

| Aspect | Environment CPF | Semantic CPF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger for Analysis | Calls that set/get environment variables or execute binaries. | Memory operations using hardcoded data keys as indices or references. |
| Primary Detection | Strings representing environment keys or binary names. | Functions setting or getting data based on predefined data keys. |
| Application Context | More suited for analyzing high-level OS interactions. | Ideal for low-level memory and firmware analysis. |

<br>

1. OS-dependent CPF: Environment CPF
    1. Key Idea
        1. Calling to a function setting (or getting) environment variables is almost necessary when sharing data through environment variables before executing another binary.
            1. Binary Execution Block Searching
            2. Path (entry-block) searching to find out program points calling environment variable setting functions
            3. reach-def analysis on path(entry-point)  → arguments values determination
            4. Determined values == ‘data keys’
            5. + ‘Binary Set Magnification Functionality’ ⇒ reach-def analysis → arg strings collection → possible binary names inference
            6. If binary names are unable to resolve → find all the binaries that rely on the data keys previously recovered.
    2. Detection Focus
        1. Program Path
        2. Binary Level Interaction
2. OS-independent CPF: Semantic CPF
    1. Key Idea
        1. IPC often relies on predefined data keys, which is often hardcoded as constants.
    2. Detection Focus
        1. Function-Level Data Flow
        2. Memory Operations
